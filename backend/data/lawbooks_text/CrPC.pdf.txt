228. When trial may proceed immediately after alteration. If the charge framed or alteration or addition
made under [....} section 227 is such that proceeding immediately with the trial is not likely, in the opinion
of the Court, to prejudice the accused in his defence or the prosecutor in the conduct of the case. the Court

232. Effect of material error. (1) If any Appellate Court, or the [Court of Session] in the exercise of
revision or of its powers under Chapter XVII, is of opinion that any person convicted of an offence was
misled in his defence by the absence of a charge by any error in the charge, It shall direct a new trial to be
held upon a charge framed in whatever manner it thinks fit.
(2) If the Court is of opinion that the facts of the case are such that no valid charge could be preferred
against the accused in respect of the facts proved, it shall quash the conviction.
Illustration
A is convicted of an offence, under section 196 of the Pakistan Penal Code, upon a charge which omits to
state that he knew the evidence, which he corruptly used or attempted to use as true or genuine, was false
or fabricated. If the Court thinks it probable that A had such knowledge, and that he was misled in his
defence by the omission from the charge; but, if it appears probable from the proceedings that A had no
such knowledge, it shall quash the conviction.

there shall be a separate charge, and every such charge shall be tried separately, except in the cases
mentioned in sections 234.235, 236 and 239.

same section of the Pakistan Penal Code or of any special or local low:

Penal Code shall be deemed to be an offence of the same kind as an offence punishable under section 380
of the said Code, and that an offence punishable under any section of the Pakistan Penal Code or of any
special or local law shall be deemed to be an offence of the same kind as an attempt to commit such
offence, when such an attempt is an offence.
